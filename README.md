## About

MedPulse is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help patients with chronic illnesses manage their medications with clarity and confidence. It runs entirely in the browser with no backend required, and can be installed on any device like a native app.

## Features

- **AI-Assisted Medication Setup** — enter a diagnosis or chronic illness and MedPulse suggests common medications, dosages, and schedules automatically
- **Today's Schedule** — a clean daily view of all upcoming and completed doses
- **Dose Tracking** — log doses as taken with a single tap; missed doses are flagged automatically
- **Dashboard Stats** — at-a-glance summary of doses taken, remaining, and adherence rate
- **History & Logs** — full record of past medication activity
- **Import / Export** — back up or transfer your medication data
- **Smart Reminders** — real-time reminder banners when a dose is due
- **PWA Installable** — works offline and installs to your home screen on any device

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no dependencies
- Web App Manifest + Service Worker for full PWA support
- Offline-capable via service worker caching

## Built With AI

This project was developed in collaboration with [Claude](https://claude.ai) (Anthropic). I used Claude Code to refine the UI, expand features, and handle deployment — treating AI as a development partner rather than just a search engine. The result is a polished, production-ready app deployed via GitHub CLI to GitHub Pages.
